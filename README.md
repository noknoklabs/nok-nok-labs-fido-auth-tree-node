```bash
../$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/gwtutorial/
```
**7.** Copy the `jwt_config.json` file (JSON Web Key Set for token validation) provided to the following directory 
```bash

```
**8.** Update the API endpoints for the login page by editing the following file:
```json
gwtutorial/config/config.js
```
Then replace the content of the file with the following:

```javascript
var nnlConfig = {
  "appsdk_version": "9.1.0",
  "version": "9.1.0",
  "tenant_id": "{{tenant}}",
  "amserver": document.location.origin,
  "apiserver": "https://cloud.noknok.com",
  "web_oob_url": "${amserver}/gwtutorial/oobrecv.html",
  "nnlappsdk_url": "${apiserver}/${tenant_id}/webapps/nnlappsdk-${appsdk_version}",
  "storage_endpoint": "${apiserver}/${tenant_id}/webapps/nnlgateway/storage",
  "reg_endpoint": "${apiserver}/${tenant_id}/webapps/nnlgateway/nnl/reg",
  "auth_endpoint": "${apiserver}/${tenant_id}/webapps/nnlgateway/nnl/auth",
  "login_url": "${amserver}/gwtutorial/login",
  "netverify_endpoint": "${amserver}/gwtutorial/nvinit"
}
```
Replace {{tenant}} with the supplied tenant name.


**9.** Restart the web container to pick up the new node. The custom node then appears in the **authentication trees menu**.

### External Dependencies

| Distribution Package | Description |

## Configuration
To enable sign in using NNL authentication Node:

- From **Authentication → Trees menu**, create a new authentication tree e.g **NNLFIDOAuthTree**

<img src="./images/createTree.png" width=60%>

- The following is an example for the authentication tree using the **NNL Validator Node**. You can add your own or standard **username/password** authenticator nodes provided by AMServer for authentication using passwords.

<img src="./images/sampletree.png">

- Save the Tree after adding all the required nodes.

- Update the **Authentication → Settings** for using the **NNLFIDOAuthTree** tree to be the default for authentication flow.

<img src="./images/treeSettings.png">

## NNL Token Validator Node
Once you install the jar file the NNL Token Validator Node is available in the tree designer pallet:

<img src="./images/node.png" width=30%>

NNL Token Validator Node is a Tree Node that serves 2 purposes. 
- It acts as a redirection node to the Nok Nok Authentication client hosted with AM server. This NNL client enables FIDO certified multi-factor authentication (FIDO UAF, FIDO U2F, WebAuthn, and FIDO2) for web applications. 
- It validates the JWT Token received from the Nok Nok Authentication Server after successful user authentication using FIDO and generates user session information.

These are the Node Configuration Properties:  

- **Node Name:** name you choose for the node, e.g., NNL Token Validator Node
- **Authorization Cookie Name:** name of the authentication cookie which contains the JWT received from NNL Auth Server, e.g., Authorization
- **AM Endpoint:** URI to the AM endpoint of the hosted AM server, e.g., https://{{hostname}}/openam
- **Login Page Endpoint:** URI to the tutorial webapp login page hosted on the server, e.g., https://{{hostname}}/nnlsignin

Update the hostname in the settings to match your installation:

## Registration Flow
Before being able to use FIDO, you need to register a FIDO credential. To register a FIDO token, use the gwtutorial web application. Navigate to https://{{am-server-domain-and-port}}/**gwtutorial** in a WebAuthn capable browser.
The **nnlsignin** application also supports registration with suggestions if an external authentication end point URL (`external_auth_endpoint`) is configured where the user can be authenticated with a regular user name and password.
Also, ensure that you create the identical user in the Access Manager identity store.

**1.** Login using a username defined in your Access Manager identity store, e.g., "demo", and hardcoded password "noknok".

<img src="./images/signinpage.png" width=50%>

**2.** Click on the FIDO Auth button. This will trigger a WebAuthn registration. Follow the registration instructions.

<img src="./images/RegisterFIDO.png" width=40%>

**3.** You will see the new registration listed.

<img src="./images/successReg.png" width=40%>

**4.** Now click the top left menu and then pick logout.

## Authentication Flow

You can test the authentication flow using the Access Manager console.

**1.** Navigate to your Access Manager console, e.g., https://{{am-server-domain-and-port}}/openam.

**2.** The **NNL Token Validator Node** redirects to the NNL Authentication Client's *Sign-In* page hosted on your Access Manager server.

<img src="./images/signinpage.png" width=50%>

**3.** User can sign in using **FIDO2**.

<img src="./images/Fido2signin.png" width=50%>

<img src="./images/fidopopup.png" width=50%>

**4.** After successful authentication User is redirected to the **consent page** on the Access Manager console.

<img src="./images/consent.png" width=50%>

**5.** Once User consent, the browser is redirected to Access Manager console and the user is logged in.
